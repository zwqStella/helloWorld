### a repository to store fragmented ideas.  
I'm zwqStella, a student of software engineering, working on programming now. I wish I can become a great engineer one day.  


From today I'll sort some classical algorithms into this repository.

####contents:
* quick sort
* binary search
* merge sort
* round robin arrangement(2^n)
* single source shortest path(greedy algorithm)
* best changes  
* job scheduling on machines
* chorus formation
* 0-1 bag
* eight queen problem
* shell sort
* use stream for collection operation


Some ideas about apps:  
1. Ten Thousand Hours


It's said that only if someone paid ten thousand hours on something can he or she become expert about that, but seldom do we know how much time we paid on something exactly. Why don't get an app to find out that?
